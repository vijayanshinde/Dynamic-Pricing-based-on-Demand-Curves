    "The code below shows complete exploration for 2 tyes of customers (Reserved and Preemtive). Basic layout of code is that there ia a function exploration which inside it takes all values from user from main loop (at the end) and uses different functions(demand function, demand generation, probability calc., dual variable calc., etc.) to conduct exploration phase.\n",
